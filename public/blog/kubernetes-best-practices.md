# Kubernetes Best Practices for Production

## Introduction

Kubernetes has revolutionized container orchestration, but running it in production requires careful planning and adherence to best practices. This post covers essential practices for production Kubernetes deployments.

## Resource Management

### Resource Requests and Limits
Always define resource requests and limits for your pods:

```yaml
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "64Mi"
    cpu: "250m"
  limits:
    memory: "128Mi"
    cpu: "500m"
```

### Namespace Strategy
- Use namespaces to organize and isolate workloads
- Implement resource quotas per namespace
- Use RBAC for access control

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Pod Security
- Run containers as non-root users
- Use read-only root filesystems
- Implement security contexts

### 2. Network Policies
- Define network policies to control pod-to-pod communication
- Use service mesh for advanced traffic management
- Implement proper ingress/egress rules

### 3. Secrets Management
- Use Kubernetes secrets or external secret managers
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Never store secrets in plain text

## Monitoring and Observability

### Metrics Collection
- Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection
- Use Grafana for visualization
- Implement custom metrics with client libraries

### Logging
- Centralize logs with ELK stack or similar
- Use structured logging
- Implement log retention policies

### Health Checks
- Implement liveness and readiness probes
- Set appropriate timeouts and thresholds
- Monitor probe failures

## Deployment Strategies

### Rolling Updates
- Use rolling update strategy for zero-downtime deployments
- Set appropriate max surge and max unavailable
- Implement proper health checks

### Blue-Green Deployments
- Use blue-green strategy for critical applications
- Implement proper traffic switching
- Have rollback procedures ready

## Storage and Persistence

### Persistent Volumes
- Use appropriate storage classes
- Implement backup strategies
- Monitor storage usage

### Stateful Applications
- Use StatefulSets for stateful applications
- Implement proper backup and restore procedures
- Consider data locality

## Networking

### Service Discovery
- Use services for internal communication
- Implement proper service naming conventions
- Use headless services when needed

### Ingress Management
- Use ingress controllers for external access
- Implement SSL/TLS termination
- Configure proper routing rules

## Conclusion

Following these best practices will help ensure a stable, secure, and maintainable Kubernetes production environment. Regular monitoring and continuous improvement are key to success.
