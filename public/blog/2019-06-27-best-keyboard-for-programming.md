## TL;DR

This is the best keyboard:

## Why?

**Our Greatest Enemies**

**The 60% / 70% Compact Keyboards**

Common on modern laptops—often Apple-inspired—these "hipster" layouts with tiny arrow keys are a productivity nightmare.

You constantly need to press the Fn key just to navigate. Highlighting with `Home`/`End`? Good luck. And let’s not even talk about hitting the down arrow instead of up.
**Use the space!**

**The QWERTZ**

Living in Germany meant I had to suffer through the German QWERTZ layout.
It was... traumatic.

I’m pretty sure the Enigma machine used QWERTZ too.

*It took me hours to find the "@" symbol. Never again -- ehem pun intended*

## Why 65% or 75% QWERTY ANSI Keyboards Are the Best

> Update: As someone rightly pointed out—75% is optimal if you want the function key row. But this post celebrates the **5% column** + compactness.

* **Compactness**: Everything is within easy reach. No wrist travel.
* **The 5% Column**: `Delete`, `Home`, `Page Up/Down`, and `End` are logically stacked and easy to use.
* `End` is right above the → arrow — perfect placement.
* `Delete` is just above `Home` and diagonal from `Backspace` — intuitive flow.
* The **Enter** key is neat and minimal. No oversized ISO monstrosities.
* **100% keyboards**? Clunky. The numpad is mostly useless and gets in the way of your mouse. And laptops fake it anyway.

My all-time favorite layout?
The **Dell Inspiron 1545**:
