**“Don’t think—act!” Oh really?!**

Let’s talk about one of the worst misconceptions I recently fell into during an interview:
**How to handle “think aloud” during algorithm questions.**

I had a few interviews where the prep materials clearly said: *“Please think out loud as you solve the problem.”*
At first, I thought—sure, sounds fair. That’s what you’d do in pair programming, right?

**Actually... no. Not like that.**

### Where It Goes Wrong

**Mistake #1:** Starting to speak the moment you finish reading the question.
This is the fastest way to sound lost—even if you’re not.

Here’s what actually happens:

A. You haven’t processed the problem yet—so you’re thinking out loud while still **misunderstanding it.**
B. If it’s a new problem, your brain needs time to explore solution paths. Your brain is **faster than your tongue.**
C. By talking too early, you start **thinking about what you’re saying** instead of just solving. You burn mental energy on forming sentences rather than forming a plan.
D. Ever heard *“Think before you speak”*? It applies more than ever here.

### A Better Approach

* Ask clarifying questions first. Understand the problem deeply.
* **Then ask for a short buffer** (3–5 minutes, or \~10% of the total time).
* Think in silence. Map out possible solution paths.
* Once you have a **vision or strategy**, then speak and involve the interviewer in your thought process.

This shows thoughtfulness, structure, and confidence—not panic or mental noise.

## "Ignoring the Business Model… When the Job Description Is Made for You!"

Sometimes you see a job ad and think, *“Wow, this sounds like it was written for me.”*
And you apply—without checking what the company actually does.

I once got to the second interview round for a company that had a **perfect JD**. Out of curiosity, I visited their website and realized I didn't agree with their business model. Then I checked Glassdoor... not great. Some red flags I’d have noticed earlier if I wasn’t rushing.

Now I’m stuck:

* Should I cancel the interview?
* What if the company evolved or the reviews were unfair?
* Am I being too picky?

Coming from a long background of limited opportunities, I used to apply to almost everything just to get in the room.
But that approach creates tension when you realize the **mission doesn't align**, and the process is already underway.

### Lesson?

**Read about the company before you apply.**
Not just the tech stack—understand their product, culture, and reputation. The JD might sound perfect, but **alignment goes deeper than bullet points.**
