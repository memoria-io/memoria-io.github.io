## Migrating from Ruby to Kotlin

The shift from Ruby to a Kotlin-based JVM stack required more than a language change—it demanded architectural realignment, improved modularity, and stronger type safety.

To streamline this transition, I delivered a comprehensive reference foundation:

1. **Shared Kotlin Modules** – Reusable code for auth, Kafka, and internal clients.
2. **Gradle Plugin Library** – Unified configurations, static analysis, and CI standards.
3. **Service Scaffold** – A production-ready Kotlin Spring Boot base using Hexagonal Architecture and DDD.

> *A structured foundation that helped teams ramp up quickly, maintain consistency, and build confidently across the new stack.*
