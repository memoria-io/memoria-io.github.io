# Grene

### Overview

Grene was a leading ecommerce platform in Denmark, serving as one of the largest technical wholesalers for the agricultural industry. Built with Java, Spring, Hibernate, and JSF, the platform managed a vast catalog—from small tools like nails to large equipment like tractors—each with detailed SKUs, images, specs, and real-time store availability.

### Untangling a Legacy Performance Bottleneck

The internal administration interface suffered from extreme latency—often taking over 5 minutes to load—largely overlooked due to the team's focus on customer-facing features.

The root issue was buried in JSF-generated complexity, involving repeated n+1 queries triggered by UI interactions. After thorough debugging and backend refactoring, combined with frontend cleanup, the load time was reduced by **75%**.

### Learnings

The fix itself was straightforward and quick to implement. The real challenge was initiating the investigation. Performance issues like this often go unreported—especially for internal tools—when they don’t block functionality outright. This highlights the importance of being proactive: improving experience isn’t just about reacting to complaints, but identifying and addressing inefficiencies before they become pain points.
