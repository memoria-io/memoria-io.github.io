### Context

Grene, a leading e-commerce platform in Denmark and one of the largest technical wholesalers in the agricultural sector. Built with Java, Spring, Hibernate, and JSF, it managed a vast catalog—ranging from nails to tractors—each product linked to SKUs, images, specifications, and real-time store availability.

### Addressing a Hidden Performance Bottleneck

The internal administration interface suffered from severe latency, often taking over five minutes to load. The issue had gone unnoticed for some time, overshadowed by the team’s focus on customer-facing features and a high tolerance from sales and operations staff.

The root cause was buried in complex JSF-generated code, where UI interactions triggered repeated n+1 queries. After identifying the issue, a combination of backend refactoring and frontend cleanup reduced the load time by **75%**.

### Insights

The fix was relatively simple but delivered immediate value—improving daily workflows and earning positive feedback from internal users.

These “silent issues” often go unreported, especially in internal tools, when they don’t block functionality outright. Yet resolving them yields quick wins. This case underscores the importance of proactive maintenance and comprehensive UI test coverage—not just waiting for problems to surface, but actively looking for friction and eliminating it.
