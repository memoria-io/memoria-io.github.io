## Overview
Built a scalable data platform processing 1TB+ daily transactions for a Fortune 500 company. The platform handles real-time analytics and machine learning pipelines, enabling data-driven decision making across the organization.

## Key Achievements
- Reduced data processing time by 75%
- Implemented real-time analytics with sub-second latency
- Scaled to handle 1TB+ daily transactions
- Built machine learning pipelines for predictive analytics

## Technical Implementation
The platform was built using a microservices architecture with Apache Kafka for event streaming, Kubernetes for orchestration, and Java for the core services. We implemented a custom data processing pipeline that optimizes for both batch and real-time processing needs.
