## Overview

Zalon by Zalando is a fashion platform that connects freelance stylists with customers. To evolve from intuition-led to data-driven decisions, we aimed to leverage Zalando’s internal tooling and data ecosystem.

## From Isolation to Integration

Zalon had been operating in isolation, lagging behind Zalando’s evolving infrastructure. With prior experience in Zalando’s internal developer platform, I led the migration to the new stack—enabling microservice creation and deployment within an hour.

This transformation paved the way for building Zalon’s first internal Datalake. I led the alignment across data engineers, scientists, product, and business teams. We implemented end-to-end ETL pipelines, GDPR compliance, and unlocked data for experimentation, A/B testing, and advanced analytics.

## Insights

Working across infrastructure, data, and product revealed the impact of high-trust, transparent culture. Clear communication across disciplines enabled unusually fast, effective collaboration and lasting technical outcomes.
