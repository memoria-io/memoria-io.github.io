## Overview

**Zalon by Zalando** is a fashion platform that connects freelance stylists with customers. To evolve from intuition-led to data-driven decisions, we aimed to leverage Zalando’s internal tooling and data ecosystem.

## From Isolation to Integration

Zalon had been operating in a bit of isolation, lagging behind Zalando’s evolving infrastructure. With prior experience in Zalando’s internal developer platform, I led the migration to the new stack—enabling microservice creation and deployment within an hour.

This transformation paved the way for building Zalon’s first internal Datalake. I led the alignment across data engineers, scientists, product, and business teams. We implemented end-to-end ETL pipelines, GDPR compliance, and unlocked data for experimentation, A/B testing, and advanced analytics.

> *Working across infrastructure, data, and product highlighted how a high-trust, transparent culture can accelerate results. Clear cross-functional communication made it possible to collaborate quickly and deliver lasting technical outcomes.*
