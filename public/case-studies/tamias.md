## Context

Tamias is a point-of-sale (POS) system that was deployed across 320 pop-up stores during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. To meet new operational and scalability demands, the system required a full reassessment of its architecture, code quality, and security posture—along with a roadmap toward a modern cloud-native solution.

## Aligning Business & Engineering

While the system’s legacy desktop nature presented technical debt, the bigger challenge lay in organizational complexity. Tamias operated across six internal companies, with a seventh being spun up to handle technology. Conway’s Law was fully in effect—technical fragmentation reflected business fragmentation.

The work began with in-depth security reports and code quality reviews of the legacy POS, surfacing critical issues. This led to defining clear technical requirements to align development with business goals, enabling a unified direction.

The scope included technical leadership across both legacy and new systems, architecting a scalable AWS-based POS backend, conducting interviews, and refining hiring criteria to strengthen the engineering team.

## Insights

Some of the most impactful work happens outside the codebase. Organizational clarity and alignment are often harder than solving technical problems—but once addressed, they unlock progress for both engineers and the business. Over time, I’ve learned that challenges begin and end with people and goals—technology is just the path in between.
