## Overview

**Tamias** is a point-of-sale (POS) system deployed across 320 pop-up stores during the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022. To meet evolving operational and scalability demands, the system required a complete reassessment of its architecture, code quality, and security posture—along with a roadmap toward a modern, cloud-native solution.

## Bridging Legacy Systems and Organizational Complexity

While the desktop-based architecture introduced significant technical debt, the greater challenge was organizational. Tamias operated to serve six internal entities within the parent group, with a new technology company forming during the transition—Conway’s Law in full effect.

Initial efforts centered on in-depth security audits and legacy code reviews, surfacing critical issues. These findings informed the definition of technical requirements aligned with business goals, paving the way for unified execution.

The scope included leading the architecture of a scalable AWS-based backend, conducting technical interviews, and refining hiring practices to support the new direction.
